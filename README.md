# Trade Break & Post-Trade Exception Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world post-trade Operations workflow commonly found in institutional financial firms. The analysis focuses on identifying settlement breaks, understanding root causes, and monitoring operational risk using Excel-based reporting and dashboards.

## Objectives
- Monitor post-trade settlement activity across asset classes
- Identify and categorize settlement breaks
- Measure resolution timelines and high-risk trade exposure
- Provide an interactive dashboard for operational risk monitoring

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 150 simulated trades across Equity, Fixed Income, and FX asset classes. Data was generated using Excel formulas to replicate realistic post-trade scenarios, including settlement failures and resolution delays.

## Key Analysis
- Trade volume analysis by asset class
- Root cause analysis of settlement breaks
- KPI tracking for failure rate, resolution days, and high-risk trades
- Interactive filtering by asset class and trade date

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- PivotTables & PivotCharts
- Advanced formulas (RANDARRAY, RANDBETWEEN, COUNTIFS)
- Conditional Formatting
- Interactive Dashboards & Slicers

## Business Relevance
This analysis mirrors post-trade exception monitoring workflows used by Operations and Risk teams to identify bottlenecks, escalate high-risk trades, and support process improvement initiatives.
